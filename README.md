# Marvel Comics Store Angular App - Code Challenge Solution

## The project:

- This is a code challenge solution build in [Angular 17](angular.dev) using the [Marvel API](developer.marvel.com/).
- [This is link for the challenge](https://github.com/contabilizei/front-end-teste)written in Portuguese, summarily describes a task to build a Comic Store fetching data from the **Marvel API**. The goal is to display this data to the user in a list of comics, allowing the user to add comics to the checkout. Additionally, it was necessary to create a way to display more information about the products, such as the author, year of publication, characters, and a summary of the story. A checkout component was also needed to display all the added comics, enabling the user to see the individual price of the comics and the total price of the comics inside the cart.
